# Udcity Deep Reinforcement Learning Project 2: Continuous Control

## Introduction
This project is part of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893), by Udacity.  

The goal of this project is to create and train a double-jointed arm agent that is able to maintain its hand in contact with a moving target for as many time steps as possible.

## Th environment

This environment has been built using the **Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents)**, which is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. You can read more about ML-Agents by perusing this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).  

The project environment provided by Udacity is similar to, but not identical to the Reacher environment on the [Unity ML-Agents GitHub page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher).  

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of **+0.1** is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location.  
Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.


#### State and action spaces
The observation space consists of **33 variables** corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm.  

Each action is **a vector with four numbers**, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number **between -1 and 1**.


#### Solving the environment

There are two versions of the environment.

* **Version 1: One (1) Agent**  
The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an **average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes**.

* **Version 2: Twenty (20) Agents**  
The barrier to solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents. In particular, the agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents). Specifically,
 * After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. That yields 20 (potentially different) scores. We then take the average of these 20 scores.  
 * That yields an average score for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).  
  
 The environment is considered solved, when the **moving average over 100 episodes** of those average scores **is at least +30**.
